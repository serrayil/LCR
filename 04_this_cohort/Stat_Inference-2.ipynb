    "In our previous session, we learned that linear regression aims to find the line of best fit, which is the line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed data points and the predicted values. This process works well when there is a clear linear relationship between the predictor variable (independent variable) and the response variable (dependent variable). However, linear regression will still attempt to fit a line even when the data is randomly scattered without a clear trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior occurs because linear regression doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying relationship between the variables—it simply seeks the line that minimizes the error (the residuals). Even if the data doesn't follow a linear pattern, the algorithm will still produce a line that \"fits\" the data in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared residuals, but this line may not be meaningful or useful for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in cases where the data is scattered without a clear trend (i.e., the relationship between the variables is not linear), the line produced by linear regression might not reflect the true nature of the data. In these situations, the line may mislead us into thinking that there is some form of linear relationship when, in fact, there is none.\n",

    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used to find the best-fitting line through a set of data points. Imagine you have a scatter plot of data points, and you want to draw a line that best represents the overall trend of the data. OLS helps determine the slope and position of that line by minimizing the total distance (errors) between the data points and the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, it’s like trying to draw a line that gets as close as possible to all the points without going too far from any of them. OLS does this by adjusting the line so that the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the line is as small as possible. This way, you get the most accurate line to predict or explain the relationship between the variables."

    "- **Coef (Coefficient)**: The coefficient for square footage is **135.1051**, which means for every additional square foot of house size, the price increases by approximately **$135.11**, holding the number of bedrooms constant. This means that if you were to compare two houses with the same number of bedrooms, the one with more square footage would be valued higher.\n",
    "- **Std err (Standard Error)**: The standard error of **6.336** for square footage suggests that the true price increase per square foot could vary by **±6.336**. This shows a relatively low level of uncertainty around the estimate of the coefficient.\n",
    "- **t-value**: The t-value for square footage is **21.324**, which is quite large. This indicates a very strong and statistically significant relationship between house size and price.\n",

This means that when comparing two houses with the same square footage, adding one more bedroom would decrease the price.\n",
